            <h3>Deploying automatic updates to production services.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="note-body">
            <p>Normally, in real life situations, services have several environments.</p>
<p>Testing
Staging/Development
Stable/Production</p>
<p>The naming may differ</p>
<p>The purpose of the testing environment, is for the
pull request code reviews, test, QA, perhaps make suggestions.</p>
<p>Once changes are approved, code review good, unittest
pass; on this environment, merge into staging environment.</p>
<p>Team of management, senior developers, and ocassionally CTO,
uses staging environment to review the system before any real
update to production, only after higher ups approve this, then
it is time for updates.</p>
<p>Usually want to automate this process deploying from a remote version control center like github, can
be done in several ways. This is simple way.</p>
<p>Assuming you have github action running on version control, triggered when a change is merged 
into the stable branch, from staging/development branch.
Some steps are taken. There is a build job,
which tests the installation script, if passes, there is a
unittest job, and if that passes, there may or may not be a
browser automation testing, using tools like pupeeter, or
selenium, or there could be tests with zapproxy as well, it
really depends on the type of system.
Here is example of what a automated deployment with version control on github; with checking, looks like.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This job has three steps, build, test, deploy, simple. At the deploy stage, at the end of the script, the update-repo.sh 
script looks similar to this, which pulls the changes from the repository and restart services. it is important to notice update-repo.sh
script is located in the machine where the production environment is hosted, it is executed through ssh, so, secrets are needed to be configured 
on the repo settings.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash 
cd ~/project-dir
git pull origin stable
# Run some other tasks pertaining to the application, like a custom version of the ./setup.sh script 
# But one that runs migrations, cleanup scripts, etc.
systemctl restart my-service.service
</code></pre>
<p>You may think, aha, idiot, bullshit, but git asks for a password, trick is is to configure the url origin on the local git repository 
config</p>
<pre><code>~$ git remote set-url origin https://your-git-account-name:ghp_this_is_your_github_token@github.com/your-git-account-name/repo-name.git
