                    <p>
                        IP is a standard protocol, STD 5 (Standard 5) meaning, it has
                        been approved by the IAB (Internet Advisory Board) a sort of
                        branch of the 
                        IEFT (Internet Engeneering Task Force) the one who issues the
                        standards,  as well as the IANA (Internet Assigned Board). IP is the Internet
                        Protocol, and IP number, is just a number used to id stuff on that protocol.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Internet Protocol is an unreliable, connectionless packet
                        delivery protocol, and it assumes that data can be lost
                        during delivery, but since it is part of the OCI model
                        (read below) it assumes higher protocols handle the loss of
                        data during delivery aka catching errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The usage of a connectionless packet delivery method
                        tackles the issue of it depending on central computing
                        centers that use other networks models. The DOD (Department of Defence of the United States) 
                        decided to deploy a network that was best suitable to evade network distuption
                        in an unforseen event that could compromise lines of
                        communication in a certain geographical location, and so the
                        network was deployed to counter any such event, and
                        it has been proven true and works.

                        like this 10.10.10.1 in a dotted decimal notation.

                            In binary it looks like this.

                    The date can serve as a distinct reference point for entries on
                    whatever storage unit u wish to persist analysis.

                    The last step is to cook a script to load this file, and either
                    send it as a batch to another server on the same network, or,
                    another network running some api that receives this data and
                    analyses with a forensics tool like OpenCTI (open source).

                    <div class="pre-code"><code>
#!/bin/bash
curl -d @/usr/share/data/monitoring/web-server-visitors.txt http://10.0.10.2/analyze-web-server-visistors</code>
                    </div>
                    <small>
                    Either add this script with 
                    <code class="happy-style">
                    crontab -e
                    </code> or add it to 
                    <code class="happy-style"> 
                    /etc/cron.hourly 
                    </code>
                    </small>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Malicious people would then instead of doing APT analysis, would
                    stupidly use a tool like nmap or greenbone to scan that IP for
                    open ports, and do recoinassance on visitors, for further
                    malicious activity.
