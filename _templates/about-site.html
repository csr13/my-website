                This site is a public archive of projects, documentation, notes, and
                interests. The site does not use cookies, or uses much custom javascript
                (it uses only small bits of javascript to clean content), and it does not
                load intrusive javascript 3rd party libraries that flood your browser and can perform action without your
                consent. This site also does not uses or loads any analytic tracking
                scripts that track your activity and expose your origin.
